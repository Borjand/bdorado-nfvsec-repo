# VNF-FG Security Framework 

This repository contains a collection of Helm charts developed as part of the experimental setup for a research paper focused on applying security to NFV VNF-FGs. Each chart represents a modular KNF (Kubernetes-based Network Function), and they are publicly available to support reproducibility and automation of the validation tests included in the paper.
